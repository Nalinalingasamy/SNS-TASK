# SNS-TASK
# Assessment for Data Analyst Role (Tableau, Power BI)
# Part 1: Theoretical Knowledge
## 1. Understanding Data Visualization
Question: Explain the importance of data visualization in data analysis. What are the key
principles of effective data visualization?
Data visualization is essential for turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.
## 2. Tableau Basics
Question: What are the main components of Tableau? Describe the process of creating a basic
dashboard in Tableau.
Main Components of Tableau: 
1. Data Source: The connection to the data which need to get analysed. It can be a database, spreadsheet, cloud service, etc. 2. Worksheet: The area where individual visualizations are created (e.g., charts, graphs, maps). 3. Dashboard: A collection of multiple worksheets and other elements (such as images or text) combined to provide a comprehensive view. 4. Story: A sequence of visualizations that work together to convey a narrative or insight. 
## 3. Power BI Fundamentals
Question: Discuss the main features of Power BI. How does Power BI differ from Tableau in
terms of functionality and use cases?
Main Features of Power BI: 
 Data Connectivity:  Connects to a wide array of data sources, including databases, cloud services, and web APIs.
  Data Modelling:  Provides robust tools for creating relationships, calculated columns, and measures to structure and analyse data.
  Visualizations:  Includes a variety of built-in visualizations (e.g., charts, maps) and supports custom visuals from the Power BI Marketplace.
 Reports and Dashboards:  Allows users to create interactive reports and dashboards that can be shared across the organization.
 Natural Language Query:  Features Q&A functionality that lets users ask questions in natural language and receive visual answers.
 Integration with Microsoft Ecosystem:  Seamlessly integrates with Microsoft products such as Excel, Azure, and Teams, enhancing its functionality in a Microsoft-centric environment.
 Power Query:  A powerful tool for data transformation and cleaning, enabling users to prepare data before analysis.
 Real-Time Data:  Supports real-time data updates and live connections, ensuring up-to-date information in reports and dashboards.

# Part 2: Practical Application
## 4. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Problem Statement: Given a dataset with missing values and inconsistencies, clean and
prepare the data for analysis.
* Imputed missing values in numerical columns using mean or median based on data distribution. 
* Filled missing values in categorical columns with mode or a default value. 
* Handled inconsistencies in data types and standardized values where necessary. 
* Used interpolation for linear values and conversion to numeric types for specific columns.
## 5. Tableau Visualization
Problem Statement: Create an interactive sales dashboard in Tableau using the provided sales
dataset.
 In this task, I have created an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyse Airbnb data, aimed at providing actionable insights into various aspects of the Airbnb rental market.  The dataset includes information such as property types, locations, prices, and guest reviews, which I used to build visualizations that highlight key metrics and trends. 
## 6. Power BI Report
Problem Statement: Develop a report in Power BI to analyze customer feedback data.
In this task, I have developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for analysing e-commerce data.  
The objective is to provide a detailed overview of key performance metrics, trends, and insights that can drive strategic decisions in the e-commerce domain. 
It provides insights into various aspects of product data collected from a major Indian e-commerce platform.

# Part 3: Advanced Analytics
## 7. Statistical Analysis
Problem Statement: Perform a statistical analysis on a given dataset to identify significant
trends and correlations. Provide a summary of your findings.
## Summary of Statistical Analysis 
Dataset Overview: The dataset contains information about various car attributes including cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, year, origin, and mpg. 
1. Data Exploration and Correlation Analysis 
2. Distribution of Continuous Variables
3. Scatter Plots for Relationship Analysi
4. Analysis by Categorical Variables
5. Hypothesis Testing

## 8. Predictive Analytics
Problem Statement: Build a predictive model to forecast sales for the next quarter using
historical sales data. Explain the steps taken and the rationale behind your model choice.
•	Data Pre-processing: Ensured correct date parsing and handled missing values.
•	Feature Engineering: Created temporal features and lag variables to aid forecasting.
•	Model Building: Employed a Random Forest model for prediction and evaluated its performance.
•	Forecasting: Generated sales forecasts for the next quarter based on historical data.

# Part 4: Scenario-Based Questions
## 9. Real-World Problem Solving
Question: Imagine you are given a large dataset with customer transactions. How would you
approach the task of identifying key customer segments and their behaviors? Describe the
steps and tools you would use.
1. Data Preparation: Load, clean, and pre-process the data.
2. Segmentation: Apply clustering techniques like K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to identify customer segments.
3. Analysis and Visualization: Analyse the segments to understand their characteristics and visualize findings.
4. Tools: Utilize Python for analysis and tools like Tableau/Power BI for visualization.

## 10. Data-Driven Decision Making
Question: A company wants to launch a new product and has collected survey data on
customer preferences. How would you use this data to help the company make an informed
decision? Outline your approach.
1. Understand the Survey Data 
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation 
3. Analyse Customer Preferences 
4. Visualize Findings
